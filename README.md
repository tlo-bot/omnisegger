SuperSegger 2 is the SuperSegger MATLAB-based suite modified to work with improved Omnipose segmentation and improved Bactrack cell tracking. Bactrack should be installed before running SuperSegger 2.

Information about Omnipose can be found at the [Omnipose Github](https://github.com/kevinjohncutler/omnipose/) and [documentation page](https://omnipose.readthedocs.io/).

Information about Bactrack can be found at the [Bactrack Github](https://github.com/yyang35/bactrack/tree/main/bactrack/).

### Software Requirements

SuperSegger 2 uses the same MATLAB toolboxes as the original SuperSegger:

- Curve Fitting Toolbox
- Deep Learning Toolbox (fka Neural Network Toolbox)
- Global Optimization Toolbox
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Optimization Toolbox
- Parallel Computing Toolbox (not necessary)
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

### Software Documentation

#### SuperSegger 2
The Github for the original SuperSegger is [here](https://github.com/wiggins-lab/SuperSegger). For more detailed documentation, the website for Supersegger can be found [here](http://mtshasta.phys.washington.edu/website/tutorials.php), the [wiki](https://github.com/wiggins-lab/SuperSegger/wiki), and documentation on functions found [here](http://mtshasta.phys.washington.edu/website/superSegger/). SuperSegger 2 uses the same MATLAB functions as the original SuperSegger.

#### Omnipose
[Omnipose](https://omnipose.readthedocs.io/) options have been preselected to work directly with Supersegger 2, but if needed, further documentation can be found by running `python -m omnipose --help` in the omnipose environment. Recommended options can also be found on the [documentation page](https://omnipose.readthedocs.io/command.html). 

#### Bactrack
[Bactrack](https://github.com/yyang35/bactrack/tree/main/bactrack/) is a cell tracking tool which uses hierarchical segmentation and mixed-integer programming optimization to determine cell lineages in timelapses. While Bactrack supports HiGHS, CBC, or Gurobi solvers, SuperSegger 2 only supports HiGHS and Gurobi. HiGHS is free, but runs more slowly than Gurobi. The Bactrack implementation of Gurobi requires a license. A [free license](https://www.gurobi.com/features/academic-named-user-license/) can be acquired for academic use. In addition, SuperSegger 2 configures Bactrack to run tracking on the masks generated by Omnipose.

### Installation Instructions

1. Install [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/help/install/install-products.html) and [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
2. Cd to desired folder and clone Supersegger 2 with git:
```
git clone https://github.com/tlo-bot/supersegger-omnipose.git
```
3. Switch to the bactrackdev branch:
```
git fetch origin

git checkout -b bactrackdev origin/bactrackdev
```
3. Add SuperSegger 2 to MATLAB path, with its subfolders (see "Setting the Path").
4. Install Bactrack:
   - Find step-by-step instructions [here](../../tree/bactrackdev/docs/install_bactrack.md). 
   - Omnipose is installed as a Bactrack dependency.
   - Further advanced installation instructions for Omnipose can be found [here](https://pypi.org/project/omnipose/).
   - GPU usage for Omnipose is discussed [here](https://omnipose.readthedocs.io/installation.html#gpu-support). The Supersegger 2 command defaults to using CPU only.

### Setting the Path

In order for Matlab to be able to find SuperSegger 2, the SuperSegger 2 folder needs to be in your path*. In the Home tab, in the Environment section, click Set Path. The Set Path dialog box appears. Click 'add folder with subfolders' and add the SuperSegger 2 folder. 

>*note that if the original SuperSegger is already installed and on the MATLAB path, you should replace the paths of the original SuperSegger folders & subfolders with the paths to the new SuperSegger 2 folders & subfolders.

### Running Supersegger 2 (GUI)

1. Put images (.tif) into a folder.
2. Convert image file names to Supersegger convention (in MATLAB with `superSeggerGui`, or `convertImageNames`; or manually with command line).
3. Run `superSeggerGui` with the desired parameters. Supersegger 2 will begin aligning the images.
   - After aligning, SuperSegger 2 will pause for segmentation through Omnipose. The Omnipose command should be displayed on the MATLAB Command Window and also automatically copied to your clipboard.
4. Open terminal/Anaconda Prompt and activate the Bactrack environment (ie `conda activate bactrack`)
   - Note that you should see the conda environment change from "(base)" to "(bactrack)"
5. Paste in the Omnipose command that was generated by MATLAB into the terminal. Wait for Omnipose to segment images and generate masks.
   - Can also change the command options in this step, if needed.
6. Once Omnipose has completed, continue running Supersegger by pressing the return/Enter key in the MATLAB Command Window.
7. At the cell tracking step, SuperSegger 2 will pause again to run Bactrack. In terminal/Anaconda prompt with the Bactrack conda environment activated, paste in the Bactrack command generated by MATLAB. The Bactrack script function will generate the links file. 
8.  Once Bactrack has completed, continue running Supersegger by pressing the return/Enter key in the MATLAB Command Window.

### Running SuperSegger 2 from MATLAB (no GUI) - Recommended!

1. Configure the analysis parameters in MATLAB: `edit processExp`. In particular, the 'Calculation Options' section should be edited depending on the desired fluorescence analysis. If not concerned with fluorescence, processExp probably doesn't need to be changed.
2. Run `processExp('dirname')` to begin running the segmentation, where 'dirname' is the path to your image files. Supersegger 2 will begin aligning the images. 
   - After aligning, SuperSegger 2 will pause for segmentation through Omnipose. The Omnipose command should be displayed on the MATLAB Command Window and also automatically copied to your clipboard.
3. Open terminal/Anaconda Prompt and activate the Bactrack environment (ie `conda activate bactrack`)
   - Note that you should see the conda environment change from "(base)" to "(bactrack)"
4. Paste in the Omnipose command that was generated by MATLAB into the terminal. Wait for Omnipose to segment images and generate masks.
   - Can also change the command options in this step, if needed.
5. Once Omnipose has completed, continue running Supersegger by pressing the return/Enter key in the MATLAB Command Window.
6. At the cell tracking step, SuperSegger 2 will pause again to run Bactrack. In terminal/Anaconda prompt with the Bactrack conda environment activated, paste in the Bactrack command generated by MATLAB. The Bactrack script function will generate the links file. 
7.  Once Bactrack has completed, continue running Supersegger by pressing the return/Enter key in the MATLAB Command Window.

### Running Omnipose and Bactrack directly from MATLAB - Recommended!


Only supported when using `processExp`. Specify autobt=1 input for processExp (ie `processExp('dirname',1)`). Disabled by default.
See documentation for setup linked below.
